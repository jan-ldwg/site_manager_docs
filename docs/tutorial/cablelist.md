The cable list page shows a list of all the cables in the system that have been added in the wiring diagram page.

## Adjusting the view

You can adjust which columns are displayed by using the button in the toolbar and deselecting the columns you do not currently need. You can also adjust the width of the columns by grabbing the line separating the headers.

## Using filters

To filter the list open the filter menu of a column by clicking on the downward arrow in the header of the column. Here you can adjust the sorting of the column and add filters by either typing in the input or selecting the checkboxes.

If you want to quickly find cable you can also try the global filter in the toolbar which does a text search and filter across all columns.

To clear all filters and sorting click on the button in the toolbar.

## Editing entries

To make changes simply switch into edit mode and start changing values right in the table. You can make the same change to multiple cables by selecting them using the checkboxes on the left side. Range selection is possible by holding down ++shift++. Any change you make to a cable in the selection will no be applied to all cables in the selection. You can also delete the selected cables by clicking the delete button in the menu that pops up when cables are selected.

## Exporting the list

You can export cables as a CSV file by selecting them and then clicking the download button in the menu that appears beneath the toolbar.
