The wiring diagram shows a graphical representation of the system. Use this view to add devices and cables or add new locations.

## Setting a filter

When opening the page for the first time, the diagram will be empty. You will need to set a filter for the locations you want to see by clicking onto the funnel in the toolbar, selecting a site and then toggling the buildings, rooms and racks you want to see.

!!! note

    It is not possible to show buildings from multiple sites at once. If you think you need this you should rethink how you have structure your locations.

## Adding locations

To add new locations switch into edit mode. You can now add and delete locations within the filter menu.

## Adding devices

To add a new device to the diagram switch into edit mode. A list of all available device types will appear on the left side. You can search by manufacturer or device name. When you have found the device type, simply click and drag it into a rack.

## Adding cables

To add a cable between two ports you can either click and drag between the two ports or click on them one after another. The cable will only be added if it is a valid connection.

## Adjusting the properties of a device or cable

If you click onto a device or cable you will select it. Selected devices and cables are highlighted. A sidebar on the right shows the details of this element. If you are in edit mode you can change some attributes.

## Deleting a device or cable

Select the device or cable and then press ++backspace++ to delete it. Deleting a device will also delete all modules and connected cables. You can select multiple elements by holding :fontawesome-brands-windows: ++ctrl++/:fontawesome-brands-apple: ++cmd++.

!!! warning

    This action can not be undone.

## Navigating in the diagram

Navigation in the diagram is similar to most drawing programs. You can pan the viewport vertically by scrolling. Hold down :fontawesome-brands-windows: ++shift++/ to pan horizontally and :fontawesome-brands-windows: ++ctrl++ to zoom. In the top left corner of are some buttons to zoom the viewport and center it. The magic wand does a relayout of the diagram.

## Working with modules

Modules can be added to devices in the sidebar. Select the device you want to add a module to, open the `Modules`section in the sidebar and add a module using the dropdown. In the dropdown whitelisted modules are modules that are confirmed by the manufacturer to work. Compatible modules will physically fit but there is no guarantee that they will function. Consult the documentation of the device to be sure.

## Using the search bar

To quickly find devices in the wiring diagram you can use the search bar. Simply enter the manufacturer, name or type of the device you are looking for. If there are multiple results use ++enter++ or the arrows in the search bar to navigate between them.

## Exporting the diagram

You can export the diagram as an svg file by clicking on the button in the toolbar.
