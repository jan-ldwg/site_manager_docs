Welcome to this quick tutorial on how to use site_manager to document a broadcast installation!

## Logging in

site_manager is completely browser based. There is no need to install any software locally onto your device. You will need an account and a link to the login page. These should be provided by your administrator. After your first login you should changes your password. For this click onto the user icon in the top right corner and click on `Account` to get to the account page. Here you can change your password by clicking on `Change Password`. You may also change your username.

## Basic page layout

Every page features a top navigation bar to quickly switch between the pages. The main pages are:

- [Wiring Diagram](./wiringdiagram.md): Shows a wiring diagram of the selected rooms. You can add locations, devices and cables and make changes.
- [Cables](./cablelist.md): Shows a list of all cables. You can sort and filter this view, edit one or more cables simultaneously and export the list.
- [Devices](./devicelist.md): Shows a list of all devices. Functionality is similar to the cables page.

Below the navigation bar you will find a page dependent toolbar. In general this features a searchbar to quickly locate elements, buttons to interact with filters and the green edit mode button. To edit any device element you will need to to first toggle on edit mode.
